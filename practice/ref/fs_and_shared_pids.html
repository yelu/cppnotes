NO!<br>
<p>
There is NO reason to think that "threads" and "processes" are separate<br>
entities. That's how it's traditionally done, but I personally think it's a<br>
major mistake to think that way. The only reason to think that way is<br>
historical baggage. <br>
<p>
Both threads and processes are really just one thing: a "context of<br>
execution". Trying to artificially distinguish different cases is just<br>
self-limiting. <br>
<p>
A "context of execution", hereby called COE, is just the conglomerate of <br>
all the state of that COE. That state includes things like CPU state <br>
(registers etc), MMU state (page mappings), permission state (uid, gid) <br>
and various "communication states" (open files, signal handlers etc).<br>
<p>
Traditionally, the difference between a "thread" and a "process" has been<br>
mainly that a threads has CPU state (+ possibly some other minimal state),<br>
while all the other context comes from the process. However, that's just<br>
_one_ way of dividing up the total state of the COE, and there is nothing<br>
that says that it's the right way to do it. Limiting yourself to that kind of<br>
image is just plain stupid. <br>
<p>
The way Linux thinks about this (and the way I want things to work) is that<br>
there _is_ no such thing as a "process" or a "thread". There is only the<br>
totality of the COE (called "task" by Linux). Different COE's can share parts<br>
of their context with each other, and one _subset_ of that sharing is the<br>
traditional "thread"/"process" setup, but that should really be seen as ONLY<br>
a subset (it's an important subset, but that importance comes not from<br>
design, but from standards: we obviusly want to run standards-conforming<br>
threads programs on top of Linux too). <br>
<p>
In short: do NOT design around the thread/process way of thinking. The <br>
kernel should be designed around the COE way of thinking, and then the <br>
pthreads _library_ can export the limited pthreads interface to users who <br>
want to use that way of looking at COE's.<br>
<p>
Just as an example of what becomes possible when you think COE as opposed <br>
to thread/process:<br>
<p>
 - You can do a external "cd" program, something that is traditionally<br>
 impossible in UNIX and/or process/thread (silly example, but the idea <br>
 is that you can have these kinds of "modules" that aren't limited to <br>
 the traditional UNIX/threads setup). Do a:<br>
<p>
 clone(CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS);<br>
 child: execve("external-cd");<br>
 /* the "execve()" will disassociate the VM, so the only reason we <br>
 used CLONE_VM was to make the act of cloning faster */<br>
<p>
 - You can do "vfork()" naturally (it meeds minimal kernel support, but <br>
 that support fits the CUA way of thinking perfectly):<br>
<p>
 clone(CLONE_VM);<br>
 child: continue to run, eventually execve()<br>
 mother: wait for execve<br>
<p>
 - you can do external "IO deamons":<br>
<p>
 clone(CLONE_FILES);<br>
 child: open file descriptors etc<br>
 mother: use the fd's the child opened and vv.<br>
<p>
All of the above work because you aren't tied to the thread/process way of<br>
thinking. Think of a web server for example, where the CGI scripts are done<br>
as "threads of execution". You can't do that with traditional threads,<br>
because traditional threads always have to share the whole address space, so<br>
you'd have to link in everything you ever wanted to do in the web server<br>
itself (a "thread" can't run another executable). <br>
<p>
Thinking of this as a "context of execution" problem instead, your tasks can<br>
now chose to execute external programs (= separate the address space from the<br>
parent) etc if they want to, or they can for example share everything with<br>
the parent _except_ for the file descriptors (so that the sub-"threads" can<br>
open lots of files without the parent needing to worry about them: they close<br>
automatically when the sub-"thread" exits, and it doesn't use up fd's in the<br>
parent). <br>
<p>
Think of a threaded "inetd", for example. You want low overhead fork+exec, so<br>
with the Linux way you can instead of using a "fork()" you write a<br>
multi-threaded inetd where each thread is created with just CLONE_VM (share<br>
address space, but don't share file descriptors etc). Then the child can<br>
execve if it was a external service (rlogind, for example), or maybe it was<br>
one of the internal inetd services (echo, timeofday) in which case it just<br>
does it's thing and exits. <br>
<p>
You can't do that with "thread"/"process".<br>
